# teamManager.github.io: Team-member Manager

As a team leader, I would like to keep track of my team members and their information for when emails, phone numbers, etc are needed in a quick access manner.

## Functions

You will be asked simple questions about your employees. As a response, you input basic information of your Engineer, Intern or Manager; and this app will format an html page for you that will sort out your employees in a orderly fashion.
